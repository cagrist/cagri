# Structural Engineering Tools

This is a collection of structural engineering tools I developed for my projects or my graduate studies. Most of the stuff is written in Python 3.

# fea/isop.py

Calculates the stiffness matrix of isoparametric 4-node quadrilateral elements.

It allows user to select between plane stress, plane strain or axisymetric conditions. 3-point Gauss integration scheme is adopted.

# fea/brick.py

Calculates the stiffness matrix of isoparametric 8-node brick elements.

3-point Gauss integration scheme is adopted.
